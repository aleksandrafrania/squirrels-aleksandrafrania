## The Central Park Squirrel Census

The file squirrels.qmd is the exploratory code. Numerous things have been changed for the final product to improve it, and will not be kept in the final presentation.

The file squirrels_presentation.qmd is the final presentation. It is, however, not yet entirely finished. It should be until January 21st.

In the project description, I have seen the requirement to summarise some of the data. However, my data set is not a great candidate for that, being almost not numerical at all, except for coordinates and the date. One could count the occurrence of unique values of some columns, but I find bar plots to represent that better.
