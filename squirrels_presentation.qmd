## About the data set

-   Data collected for the 2018 Squirrel Census project in NYC

-   3,023 unique squirrel sightings throughout October 2018

-   31 columns including squirrel location, fur color, reaction to humans, etc.

## Not much to summarize, but...

... about the above ground sighter measurement

```{r}
squirrels <- read.csv("data/squirrel_data.csv", na.strings = c("", "NA"))
```

```{r}
# Since almost none of the data is numerical, it is difficult to make an interesting summarizing table. For one, it does not make any sense to display quantiles and extrema of geographical coordinates. 
# One can count the occurrence of unique values, but this can be just as well visualized in a bar plot, for instance (included later in the presentation).

# The column Above.Gound.Sighter.Measurment may be interesting to summarise, let us clean it up a bit:

# Replacing all FALSE values with 0 (FALSE means that squirrel was seen from the ground, in other words, the sighter was at height 0)
squirrels$Above.Ground.Sighter.Measurement[squirrels$Above.Ground.Sighter.Measurement == FALSE] <- 0

# The most common value for this column is 0 so we will replace all missing values with 0, since there are only 114 NAs
squirrels$Above.Ground.Sighter.Measurement[is.na(squirrels$Above.Ground.Sighter.Measurement)] <- 0

# The entries are of type "character" so we will change the type to "integer"
squirrels$Above.Ground.Sighter.Measurement <- as.integer(squirrels$Above.Ground.Sighter.Measurement)

library(dplyr)

squirrels |> 
  summarise(min = min(Above.Ground.Sighter.Measurement),
            max = max(Above.Ground.Sighter.Measurement),
            q25 = quantile(Above.Ground.Sighter.Measurement, 0.25),
            median = median(Above.Ground.Sighter.Measurement),
            q75 = quantile(Above.Ground.Sighter.Measurement, 0.75),
            mean = mean(Above.Ground.Sighter.Measurement),
            sd = sd(Above.Ground.Sighter.Measurement))
```

Most values are 0 and the maximum is very high, let's see how values different from 0 behave, also excluding the worst outliers:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(squirrels[squirrels$Above.Ground.Sighter.Measurement != 0 & squirrels$Above.Ground.Sighter.Measurement <= 50, ], 
       aes(x = Above.Ground.Sighter.Measurement)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "skyblue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of squirrel sighters' positions above ground",
       x = "Sighter position in meters (height)",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## All sightings on one map

```{r}
library(pacman)
library(ggmap)
library(osmdata)
library(ggspatial)

#Create a stadia terrain (osm) map
register_stadiamaps("67db8286-2337-4988-b5a0-1a5e1adbeba4", write = FALSE)

borders <- c(bottom = 40.762, top = 40.8025, left = -74, right = -73.93)
map <- get_stadiamap(borders, zoom = 15, maptype = "stamen_terrain")

ggmap(map) +
  geom_point(data = squirrels, 
             aes(x = X, y = Y), 
             size = 0.3) +
  labs(title = "Squirrel sightings in Central Park, October 2018", 
       x = "Longitude", 
       y = "Latitude") +
  annotation_north_arrow(location = "br", which_north = "true")
```

## Sightings throughout the month

The sightings took place on only 11 out of 31 days

```{r}
# Cleaning up the date format
squirrels$Date <- as.Date(as.character(squirrels$Date), format = "%m%d%Y")
```

```{r}
# I managed to deploy my app and wanted to include a link in the presentation but did not succeed, hence this code needs to be run to use the app.

# For some reason, the dates of days with no sightings disappeared on the app

library(shiny)
library(rsconnect)

all_dates <- seq(as.Date("2018-10-01"), as.Date("2018-10-31"), by = "days")

squirrels <- squirrels[order(squirrels$Date), ]
unique_dates <- unique(squirrels$Date)


start_date <- as.Date("2018-10-01")
end_date <- as.Date("2018-10-31")

ui <- fluidPage(
  sliderInput("day", "Select Day", min = 1, max = length(unique_dates), value = 1, step = 1),
  plotOutput("mapPlot")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$mapPlot <- renderPlot({
    # Create a map for the selected day
    map <- get_stadiamap(borders, zoom = 14, maptype = "stamen_terrain")
    
    subset_data <- squirrels[squirrels$Date == unique_dates[input$day], ]
    
    ggmap(map) +
      geom_point(data = subset_data,
                 aes(x = X, y = Y), 
                 size = 0.1) +
      labs(x = NULL,
           y = NULL,
           title = paste("Date:", format(subset_data$Date, "%Y-%m-%d")), 
           subtitle = paste("Sightings:", nrow(subset_data)))
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

## Sightings during the first 3 weeks of October 2018

```{r}
# Split October 2018 into weeks, only taking the first 3 weeks (last sighting occurs on October 20th so plotting past that date is useless)
week1 <- squirrels[squirrels$Date >= "2018-10-01" & squirrels$Date <= "2018-10-07", ]
week2 <- squirrels[squirrels$Date >= "2018-10-08" & squirrels$Date <= "2018-10-14", ]
week3 <- squirrels[squirrels$Date >= "2018-10-15" & squirrels$Date <= "2018-10-21", ]
```

```{r}
new_borders <- c(bottom = 40.762, top = 40.8025, left = -73.99, right = -73.94)
new_map <- get_stadiamap(new_borders, zoom = 15, maptype = "stamen_terrain")

map1 <- ggmap(new_map) +
    geom_point(data = week1,
               aes(x = X, y = Y), 
               size = 0.1) +
    labs(x = NULL,
         y = NULL,
         title = "Week 1", 
         subtitle = paste("Sightings:", nrow(week1)))

map2 <- ggmap(new_map) +
    geom_point(data = week2,
               aes(x = X, y = Y), 
               size = 0.1) +
    labs(x = NULL,
         y = NULL,
         title = "Week 2", 
         subtitle = paste("Sightings:", nrow(week2)))

map3 <- ggmap(new_map) +
    geom_point(data = week3,
               aes(x = X, y = Y), 
               size = 0.1) +
    labs(x = NULL,
         y = NULL,
         title = "Week 2", 
         subtitle = paste("Sightings:", nrow(week3)))

library(patchwork)

(map1 | map2 | map3)
```

It looks like week 2 was the busiest!

## Week vs Weekend

```{r}
# Split October 2018 into weekdays and weekends, only taking the first 3 weeks
weeknoend1 <- squirrels[squirrels$Date >= "2018-10-01" & squirrels$Date <= "2018-10-05", ]

weekend2 <- squirrels[squirrels$Date >= "2018-10-13" & squirrels$Date <= "2018-10-14", ]
weeknoend3 <- squirrels[squirrels$Date >= "2018-10-15" & squirrels$Date <= "2018-10-19", ]
weekend3 <- squirrels[squirrels$Date >= "2018-10-20" & squirrels$Date <= "2018-10-21", ]
```

```{r}

    geom_point(data = weekend1,
               aes(x = X, y = Y), 
               size = 0.1) +

((map11 | map12 | map13) / (map21 | map22 | map23))

```

## Hectare sightings

The entire Central Park as a rectangle can be divided into squares, 42 in length and 9 in width. Let's inspect the sightings under the form of a heatmap:

```{r}
# Splitting the hectare names into 2-digit number and letter
squirrels$XX <- as.numeric(substr(squirrels$Hectare, 1, nchar(squirrels$Hectare) - 1))
squirrels$Y <- substr(squirrels$Hectare, nchar(squirrels$Hectare), nchar(squirrels$Hectare))

# Ordering the letters so that the y-axis has an alphabetical order going down
squirrels$Y <- factor(squirrels$Y, levels = rev(levels(factor(squirrels$Y))))

# Grouping the squirrels by both hectare name parts and counting the occurrences
squirrels_aggregated <- squirrels |> 
  group_by(XX, Y) |> 
  summarize(Squirrel_Count = sum(Hectare.Squirrel.Number), 
            .groups = 'drop')

max_count <- max(squirrels_aggregated$Squirrel_Count)
breaks <- seq(0, max_count, length.out = 11)

ggplot(squirrels_aggregated, 
       aes(x = XX, 
           y = Y)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = Squirrel_Count), 
            color = "white") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma", 
                       breaks = breaks, 
                       labels = round(breaks)) +
  labs(title = "Squirrel occurrences per hectare",
       x = NULL,
       y = NULL,
       fill = "Squirrel count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_fixed()
```

It looks like the squirrels enjoy The Ramble (most forest-like part of the park).

## AM vs PM

```{r}
am_squirrels <- squirrels[squirrels$Shift == "AM", ]
pm_squirrels <- squirrels[squirrels$Shift == "PM", ]
```

```{r}
# This chunk stopped workinng after a while; when I remove the last line, it works, but of course does not plot

# am_map <- ggmap(new_map) +
#     geom_point(data = am_squirrels,
#                aes(x = X, y = Y), 
#                size = 0.1,
#                color = "lightskyblue2") +
#     labs(x = NULL,
#          y = NULL,
#          title = "Squirrels during AM", 
#          subtitle = paste("Sightings:", nrow(am_squirrels)))
# 
# pm_map <- ggmap(new_map) +
#     geom_point(data = pm_squirrels,
#                aes(x = X, y = Y), 
#                size = 0.1,
#                color = "dodgerblue4") +
#     labs(x = NULL,
#          y = NULL,
#          title = "Squirrels during PM", 
#          subtitle = paste("Sightings:", nrow(pm_squirrels)))
# 
# (am_map | pm_map)
```

## Fur colors of the Central Park squirrels

```{r}
# Plotting the different fur colors counts of the Central Park squirrels
bar_plot <- ggplot(squirrels, aes(x = Primary.Fur.Color, fill = Primary.Fur.Color)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL) +
  scale_fill_manual(name = NULL,
                    values = c("black", "sienna", "darkgray")) +
  theme_minimal()

# Plotting the pie chart
pie_chart <- ggplot(squirrels, aes(x = "", fill = Primary.Fur.Color)) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.1, color = "white") +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  labs(fill = NULL) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("black", "sienna", "darkgray")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none")

(bar_plot | pie_chart)
```

## Squirrel sightings per color

```{r}
black_squirrels <- squirrels[squirrels$Primary.Fur.Color == "Black", ]
cinnamon_squirrels <- squirrels[squirrels$Primary.Fur.Color == "Cinnamon", ]
gray_squirrels <- squirrels[squirrels$Primary.Fur.Color == "Gray", ]
```

```{r}
# This chunk stopped workinng after a while, same reason as previous

# new_new_map <- get_stadiamap(new_borders, zoom = 15, maptype = "outdoors")
# 
# black_map <- ggmap(new_new_map) +

#          subtitle = paste("Sightings:", nrow(cinnamon_squirrels)))
# 
# gray_map <- ggmap(new_new_map) +
#     geom_point(data = gray_squirrels,
#                aes(x = X, y = Y), 
#                size = 0.1,
#                color = "darkgray") +
